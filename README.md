# Space Invaders: Reimagined

This is my version of the classic **Space Invaders** game, developed using **GDevelop**. The game stays true to the original concept but introduces new mechanics, levels, and increasing challenges as you progress.

## Gameplay

In this game, you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, using the **WASD** keys to move and the **Spacebar** to shoot. The goal is to destroy waves of alien invaders while avoiding their fire. Each level introduces new challenges, making the game progressively more difficult as you advance.

### Controls:
- **WASD**: Move the spaceship
- **Spacebar**: Shoot

### Features:
- **Level Progression**: Each level is locked until the previous one is completed, creating a sense of progression and accomplishment.
- **Challenging Enemies**: In **Level 2**, the aliens shoot **two strikes** instead of one, making them harder to dodge.  
- **Boss Fight**: **Level 3** introduces a **boss** fight, giving you a challenging and epic showdown.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: As the levels progress, enemies become more difficult and add unique twists to the gameplay.

### Screenshots:
Here are a few screenshots from the game:
